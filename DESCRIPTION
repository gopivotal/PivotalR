Description: Provides an R interface for the VMware Data stack running on
    'PostgreSQL' or 'Greenplum' databases with parallel and distributed
    computation ability for big data processing. 'PivotalR' provides an R
    interface to various database operations on tables or views. These
    operations are almost the same as the corresponding native R operations.
    Thus users of R do not need to learn 'SQL' when they operate on objects in
    the database. It also provides a wrapper for 'Apache MADlib', which is an
    open-source library for parallel and scalable in-database analytics.
